        We are an organization that helps students learn and apply software
        engineering principles to real-world applications. We host weekly
        workshops on topics like software design to help bridge the gap between
        what students need to know for industry and what they&apos;re taught in
        classes. These concepts help with building complex software systems and
        better prepare members for team projects, internships, and careers in
        software development.
